My project is a DMP style django web project that implements JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project is mobile friendly but optimized for desktops. 
CSS is used extensively throughout the project to create an optimal user experience.

Pages:

    Home:
        JavaScript is used to create fading animatiosn when the screen scrolls to each div. HTML and CSS are used for structure. 

    About: 
        Javascript is used to do partial animations based on the scroll position to animate in the profiles and past groups. 
        CSS animations are used for the top slide and the ending line drawing. 

    Cards:
        Javascript is used to fetch the cards info from JSON objects, and is then processed to load the cards to the page. A loading screen displays
        while images are loaded. When a user clicks on each card a popover modal is displayed using Javascript, and the modal is populated with the 
        cards for viewing using Javascript.

    Resources:
        CSS is used to create a fancy scrolling effect on the resources list. 

    Music/Videos:
        Javascript is used minimally on these pages to fade in the images after they load instead of displaying the loading images to the user. 


This project requires the DMP environment to run the local code, but the website is live at https://rifftidemusic.com
